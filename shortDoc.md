## Using AI Tools to Complete the Project

In completing this project, I leveraged AI tools to enhance efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, I utilized the free versions of Claude and ChatGPT, employing prompt engineering techniques to maximize their effectiveness. By providing specific and detailed instructions, and occasionally role-playing scenarios, I was able to guide the AI to generate the desired outputs.

Claude was instrumental in generating code and providing sample snippets. Its ability to understand and produce coherent code snippets significantly sped up the development process. On the other hand, ChatGPT was invaluable for debugging and resolving issues within the code. Its advanced language model capabilities allowed it to identify and suggest fixes for errors that I encountered.

One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the AI understood the context and requirements of the task. By refining my prompts and being explicit in my instructions, I was able to overcome this hurdle. The combination of Claude for code generation and ChatGPT for debugging created a robust workflow that facilitated the successful completion of the project.
